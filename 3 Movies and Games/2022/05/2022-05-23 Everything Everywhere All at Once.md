#### Notes
Things that this reminded me of:
- Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy
- The Matrix
- The Nines
- Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
- Slaughterhouse-Five
- Alamut

A fantastic movie! Really awesome. It takes different ideas like in the stories above and turns it up a notch, and tells a story about family, expectations, self-doubt/-confidence/-acceptance.

I pre-/ordered the DVD just now, because I want to re-watch immediately. I’m already forgetting what I want to say about it, but I really enjoyed it. Funny, sad, profound. Maybe the latter profundity was especially “poignant” in contrast to the initial setting of mundanity. 

The obvious plot of expectations towards life in the role of a first (and second) generation immigrant is there, but it sort of takes a back seat to the filial relationship of the main character, Evelyn. Because here we see not simply her projection onto her daughter of having a plan and making something out of her life, but the apparently involuntary conservatism that Evelyn brings, perhaps from the “old country”. She says at one point that her daughter, Joy, is young and is constantly changing herd. This is a rather obvious parallel to her own life, since we witness Evelyn try and deduct lots of “hobby” equipment, such as a karaoke machine, as the remnants of dreams of possible life-paths lost.

In this regard there is an unfortunate comparison to be made to [[2021-09-07 Haig, The Midnight Library]], which reads like a bad self-help book, since the main character does commit suicide but then in those between worlds chooses to return to life after all, in an obvious almost retelling of *It’s a wonderful Life*, both of which I find depressing. Haig shouldn’t be giving out life advice, especially since this book is touted online as a book for depressed people, since she does very much (attempt to) kill herself.

[[2022-05-23 Everything Everywhere All at Once]], however, evades the cloyingly sweet self-help-ish-ness, since it’s overarching message is a simplistically nihilistic “Nothing matters”. Thus sorting making a connection to [[2022-04-03 Bartol, Alamut]]’s “Nothing is true, everything is permitted.” In a life, or a multiverse, where all expectations are simply illusions, we can boil life to its most basic tenets and do whatever the fuck makes us happy.
